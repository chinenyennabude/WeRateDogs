Data wrangling process was completeted on the three datasets ```twitter_archive```, ```image_predictions.tsv```, and ```tweet_df```, where some content and structural issues were addressed. After the wrangling process all dataset has been merged into a master dataset ```master_data.csv```.
Next I analysed the master dataset, Data analysis is the process involved in inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modelling data with the goal of extracting useful insights and informing conclusions to support decision making.
The cleaned```master_data.csv``` contains 2073 rows and 22 columns. In order to answer the question **Which Dog is the most popular** and **Find the relationship between favourite and retweet count**, I used visualizations to explore the WeRateDog ```master_data.csv```.# WeRateDogs
